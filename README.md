UCBcode-Matlab
==============

Matlab code created as a graduate student at UC Berkeley. The folder 'OtherPeoplesFunctions' contains code downloaded from the Matlab File Exchange and other providers; I recommend you download such packages from their original source instead of using the versions contained here.
